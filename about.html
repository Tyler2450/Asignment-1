        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a high school graduate of Mount Saint Agnes Academy and currently a student at Ontario Tech University 
            studying a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. This past summer, I was enrolled in the Technology Leadership 
            Forum, where I was connected with Bermuda Hospital Board for summer employment. I have also interned at 
            XBTO, learning crypto databasing with Python. Throughout my time interning at these establishments, I have gained a 
            diverse set of skills in networking, cybersecurity, programming, and communications. I am eager to grow in my 
            profession and gain as much experience as I can.
        </p>
