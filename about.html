        <img src="IMG_0460.jpg" alt="Tyler Furtado">
        <p>I am a high school graduate of Mount Saint Agnes Academy and currently a student at Ontario Tech University studying a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology. This past summer, I was enrolled in the Technology Leadership Forum where I was connected with Bermuda Hospital Board for summer employment. I have also interned at XBTO, learning crypto databasing with Python.</p>
        <p>Throughout my internships, I have gained skills in networking, cybersecurity, programming, and communications. I am eager to grow in my profession and gain more experience.</p>
